                    LEXINGTON, Ky. (LEX 18) — A University of Kentucky researcher has discovered a 
                    link between a patient being overweight and breast cancer and may have found a 
                    way to slow the progression of the disease in those patients.

                    Dr. Ren Xu has spent five years researching tumor micro-environment. He has 
                    identified a protein, HSP47, that, if manipulated, can reduce the rate of tumor 
                    growth.
                </p>
                <p class = "index-content-text">
                    “This protein can actually contribute to breast cancer metastasis, help the cancer 
                    cells survive well in the secondary organ for example lung and other organs,” said 
                    Dr. Xu. "

                <p class = "index-content-text">
                    He was able to test a drug against HSP47 to block its production.

                <p class = "index-content-text">
                    “Turn off the HSP47 and it reduces the body weight in the mice," said Dr. Xu. "More 
                    importantly the tumor growth in those mouse are dramatically reduced."
