                <p class = content-heading>Regulation and Function of ECM Remodeling in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) Progression and Drug Resistance</p>
                <p class = content-body-text>Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype with poor prognosis,
                disproportionately affecting young African-American women. TNBC lacks
                responsiveness to hormone therapy and HER2-targeted treatments, making it imperative
                to uncover the mechanisms driving its progression and to identify actionable therapeutic
                targets. Our research has identified a transcriptional network governing extracellular
                matrix (ECM) remodeling and several key regulatory hubs that are significantly
                upregulated in human TNBC (Cancer Res, 2015; Nat Commun, 2018; PNAS, 2023). We
                have also uncovered novel crosstalk between ECM remodeling, epigenetic regulation,
                and metabolic reprogramming during breast cancer progression (PNAS, 2023). These
                findings have significantly advanced our understanding of tumor–microenvironment
                interactions and their role in cancer cell plasticity.
                Using genetically engineered mouse models, patient-derived xenografts, and tumor
                organoids, we are currently evaluating whether targeting these ECM regulatory hubs can
                suppress TNBC progression and enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy and
                immunotherapy. </p>

                <p class = content-body-text>Interactions between cancer cells and stromal components within the tumor
                microenvironment (TME) are critical drivers of breast cancer progression and metastasis.
                Our current work focuses on how intercellular communication—mediated by ECM
                components, metabolites, and extracellular RNAs—promotes obesity-associated breast
                cancer progression, metastasis, and immune evasion. These projects aim to define novel
                mechanisms of tumor-stroma interaction and uncover potential therapeutic strategies to
                disrupt these signaling networks. </p>
